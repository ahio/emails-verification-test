# TEST EMAILS VERIFICATION

An experimental application designed to validate emails (currently lacking proper verification,
instead utilizing simulated verification), coupled with Server-Sent Events (SSE) functionality. 
This enables the server to publish data to subscribers, allowing them to observe real-time updates on status changes.

## HOW TO START

In the project directory you can run in console:

##### `docker compose up -d`
